## Known Issues

ISS-1: Swapping between Landscape and Portrait mode in the Stat Tracking page causes unintended behavior.

ISS-2: The application may skip frames during some activities when parsing files.

ISS-3: Pop-up for starting on Offense/Defense not implemented. As such, on activity start, half-time end, all actions are temporarily made available as a workaround.

ISS-4: Certain input sequences on the Stat Tracking page register unwanted events. In part due to ISS-3.

ISS-5: On substitution, the previous player with disc is stored, but is not displayed correctly in the list as being selected.

ISS-6: On View Games screen, game entries with a long team name will overflow to the next line, date cannot be seen. Date is displayed unformatted.
